Please provide the 20 digit Document Control Number associated to your Fingerprint Applicant Request.<br>
<br>
The applicant is required to include their document control number (DCN) on their personnel security screening application form. This allows the Contract Security Program to continue processing their personnel security screening request.<br>
<br>
Without this number, the program will be unable to match the incoming criminal record check results from the RCMP, with their application, delaying the applicant's request. Please ensure the DCN is accurate.
