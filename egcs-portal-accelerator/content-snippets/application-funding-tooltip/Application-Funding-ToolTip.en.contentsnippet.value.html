The funding calculation is based on the annual expenses of the entire organization except for a) university and municipal organizations and b) Indigenous organizations that fall under a larger entity (e.g. Band Council). Here, the funding calculation is based on the annual expenses specific to the heritage organization (e.g. university museum), not the annual expenses of the entire organization.
